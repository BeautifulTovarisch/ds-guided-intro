# Publish/Subscribe

Asynchronous message-passing facilitated by a message broker has come into vogue
among software professionals. Proponents claim _message-oriented_ architecture
solves the issues of scalability and coupling among microservices, while others
voice the opinion that pub-sub leads to complex solutions which are difficult to
scale correctly.

This module lays a rigorous foundation for the pub-sub model. This is important
for programmers to think critically about software trends and come to their own
conclusions about what is appropriate for the systems they build.

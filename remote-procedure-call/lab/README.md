# RPC Lab

The purpose of this lab is to gain familiarity with a modern RPC tool. The gRPC
framework is used to build a straightforward API. Learning objectives include:

- Experience working with gRPC
- Introduction to binary serialization (Protobuf)
- Developing your own opinion of gRPC vs "traditional" REST API development

You will need to consule the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) documentation to
complete the tasks in this lab.

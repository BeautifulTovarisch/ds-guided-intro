# Concurrency

This module provides resources and exercises on concurrent programming and its
importance in distributed systems. Programmers who have taken an introductory
systems or operating systems course should find this material familiar. Those
without prior experience writing concurrent programs should approach this topic
slowly and deliberately.

A solid fundamental understanding of concurrency is important not only to write
programs that take full advantage of modern hardware, but in identifying subtle
bugs that arise in virtually any distributed system. Detecting concurrency bugs
is extraordinarily difficult; many of the tools normally used to find errors in
an implementation are unreliable when non-determinism is introduced.

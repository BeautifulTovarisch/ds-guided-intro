# Clocks

This module discusses the distinction between physical and logical clocks and
scenarios in which either are appropriate. The true importance of clocks will
become apparent in later modules that cover consistency and consensus.

<!-- TODO lab on monotonic and logical clocks -->

> NOTE: The optional readings in the module are particularly good examples of
> how relying on timestamps can lead to unexpected results. You should consider
> reading them if you have the time.

## Objectives

- Discover the various types of clocks and their uses in distributed systems
- Understand issues that can arise when relying on physical timestamps
- Develop a model for ordering events in distributed systems
